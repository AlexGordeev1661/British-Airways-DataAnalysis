But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"\\u2705 Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"\\u2705 Trip Verified |  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim.

IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"\\u2705 Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"\\u2705 Trip Verified |  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!!

But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim.

But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim.

But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim.

But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lemmatized_reviews\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that\\u2019s about it. IFE didn\\u2019t work but wasn\\u2019t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon.\",\n          \"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a \\u2018chic\\u2019 cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It\\u2019s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was \\u00a3200 one way (\\u00a3600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.\",\n          \"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7435426531143726,\n        \"min\": -0.9876,\n        \"max\": 0.9982,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 630,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.1868,\n          -0.9349,\n          0.0534\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
